The proliferation of the dark web has provided a platform for illicit activities, including the predation of vulnerable individuals by sexual predators and the spreading of sexually abusive material (SAM) which includes any visual, written or audio material that depicts or describes sexual abuse of any individual. The goal of this project, "Identifying Sexual Predators in Dark Web Forums," is to improve the detection and identification of sexual predators on dark web forums by utilizing machine learning. The objective of this project is to analyse chat logs from the PAN12 dataset and identify possible predators in Dark web Forums with high accuracy by building a robust model based on the Multinomial Naive Bayes method.
In this work, the viability of using machine learning to detect possible sexual predators in threads/posts on dark-web forums is examined. The study's main objective is to identify trends in textual material that point to predatory conduct.
In order to determine the most efficient method for predator recognition, the study investigates a variety of machine learning models. We used Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods for training and testing models in addition to the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. A confusion matrix, which offered information on each classifier's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, was used to assess the performance of these models.
My findings reveal that while the Random Forest method exhibits promise with a high degree of precision and recall, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier performs effectively in identifying sexual predators. Despite their effectiveness, the Decision Tree and SVM classifiers were less accurate than the Random Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes models.
Through the detection and mitigation of sexual predators' activities on the dark web, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to improve online safety. The knowledge gathered from this study may play a key role in creating more advanced instruments to counteract online sexual predation for law enforcement and cybersecurity experts.
